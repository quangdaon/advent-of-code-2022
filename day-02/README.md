# Day Two: Java

My solutions for [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) of AOC 2022, written in Java. To run this program, you will need the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), along with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) installed.

## Running Tests

```
mvn clean test
```

## Running Program

You will need to create a file called `input.txt` inside the `inputs` folder for a valid input from AOC for this challenge.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

Warning: This program outputs the solutions to BOTH parts of Day 2. Beware of spoilers.
