# Day One: Ruby

My solutions for [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) of AOC 2022, written in Ruby. To run this program, you will need the [Ruby runtime](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed. This is built in and likely works best in Ruby 2.7.5.

## Running Tests

```
ruby -I . ./tests/processor.test.rb
```

## Running Program

You will need to create a file called `input.txt` inside the `inputs` folder for a valid input from AOC for this challenge.

```
ruby -I . ./src/program.rb
```

Warning: This program outputs the solutions to BOTH parts of Day 1. Beware of spoilers.
