# Day Four: Visual Basic (VB.NET)

My solutions for [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4) of AOC 2022, written in VB using the .NET 6 SDK/runtime. To run this program, you will need [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.

## Running Tests

```
dotnet test .\AdventOfCode2022.App.Tests\
```

## Running Program

You will need to create a file called `input.txt` inside the `inputs` folder for a valid input from AOC for this challenge.

```
dotnet run --project .\AdventOfCode2022.App\
```

Warning: This program outputs the solutions to BOTH parts of Day 4. Beware of spoilers.
