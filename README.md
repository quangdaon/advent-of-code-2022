# \*SPOILERS\* Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Naturally, it contains spoilers for the challenges.

### Languages

My personal challenge for this year is to solve each challenge using a different programming language. Disclaimer: I am not an expert in some (most!) of these languages, and do not intend to spend more than a few hours on each one, so some of my code might not follow the language/community's best practices. Some might find my code offensive, but that is not my intent. Please proceed at your own risk.

\*: Languages that were new to me.
