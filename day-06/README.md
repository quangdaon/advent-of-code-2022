# Day Five: JavaScript (Node.JS)

My solutions for [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6) of AOC 2022, written in Dart. To run this program, you will need [Dart](https://dart.dev/) installed.

## Running Tests

```
dart test
```

## Running Program

You will need to create a file called `input.txt` inside the `inputs` folder for a valid input from AOC for this challenge.

```
dart run
```

Warning: This program outputs the solutions to BOTH parts of the day. Beware of spoilers.
